## Write a function that reads a directory full of files and reports 
## the number of completely observed cases in each data file. The function 
## should return a data frame where the first column is the name of the file 
## and the second column is the number of complete cases. 
## A prototype of this function follows


##################
complete <- function(directory, id = 1:332) {
  ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
  ## the location of the CSV files
  mylist <- list.files(directory, full.names=TRUE) 
  nobs <- numeric() # numbers of observation
  
  for(i in id) {
    mydata <- read.csv(mylist[i])
    mysum <- sum(complete.cases(mydata))
    nobs <- c(nobs, mysum)
  }
  data.frame(id, nobs)
}
## You can see some example output from this function below. 
##The function that you write should be able to match this output. 
## Please save your code to a file named complete.R. To run the submit script 
## for this part, make sure your working directory has the 
## file complete.R in it.

#>complete("specdata",1)
#id nobs
#1  1  117
#> complete("specdata", c(2, 4, 8, 10, 12))
#id nobs
#1  2 1041
#2  4  474
#3  8  192
#4 10  148
#5 12   96
#> complete("specdata", 30:25)
#id nobs

#3 28  475
#4 27  338
#5 26  586
#6 25  463
#> complete("specdata", 3)
